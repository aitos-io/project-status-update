# BoAT Project Status Update
Date: June 13th, 2023

## Update Summary
Version 3.1.0 is the first version that BoAT adopts an new architecture called BIA (BoAT Infra Arch). 

BIA is a cross-platform application framework that provides a unified application abstraction interface for BoAT applications. It abstracts a lot of application APIs for various platforms. Starting with this release, the BoAT code repository is divided into BoAT-SupportLayger, BoAT-Engine, BoAT-ProjectTemplate repositories.

BoAT-SupportLayer is the core layer of the BIA architecture which provides a unified cross-platform application abstraction interface to the upper layer. The OSAL interfaces are defined and implemented to abstract the operating system APIs. The cellular chips/modules L610, ML307A, Unisoc 8850, FG150 and FM650 are adapted.

BoAT-Engine is a blockchain application component implemented in the Composable BoAT Core layer of the BIA architecture. In this release version, Ethereum, Hyperledger Fabric, Chainmaker, Venachain, PlatON, PlatONE and FISCO-BCOS blockchains are adapted and supported.

BoAT-ProjectTemplate is a universal development template for developing applications based on the BIA infrastructure.
